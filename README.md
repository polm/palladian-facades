A Palladian facade generator for [ProcJam 2015](https://itch.io/jam/procjam), written in Livescript using SVG.

[Andrea Palladio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Palladio) was a great architect from the 16th century, perhaps best known for his [Four Books](http://lccn.loc.gov/47044047) (high-quality PDF from the Library of Congress). The influence of his work is wide but is particularly visible in some early American architecture. Personally I went on many field trips to [Drayton Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drayton_Hall) growing up. In a stroke of luck many of his designs are very geometric and regular, so capturing something of their feel in automatically generated SVG isn't actually that hard.
